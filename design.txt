Guitar output -> filtering? -> compression? -> GPIO
GPIO + ADC module -> stack buffer
FFT on buffer -> frequencies
Frequencies -> filtering -> output
Ouput signal -> amp? -> filtering?



Considerations:
	Minimize delay picking ADC buffer size
	FFT bucket count
	DAC ?
	Input signal compression and filtering, possibily separate bands?
